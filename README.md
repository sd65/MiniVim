## Goals

- No bullshit default key mappings
- Mimic Sublime Text / Shell key mappings
- Minimal: one file, **no plugin needed!**

## Automated setup

- Clone this repo to the folder of your choice:

`git clone https://github.com/sd65/MiniVim.git`

- Go inside this repo:

`cd MiniVim`

- Launch the install script and follow the instructions:

`./install.sh`

- It's ready! :smile: Launch Vim:

`vim`

## Manual setup

If you can't clone the repo and do the above steps, just download the .vimrc to your home dir (backup your current .vimrc before).

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sd65/MiniVim/master/vimrc -O ~/.vimrc`

And then add `stty -ixon` to your .zshrc or .bashrc (your shell will ignore XON/XOFF signals. Needed to remap Ctrl S, Ctrl Q). It will prevent the terminal from "freezing" when saving a file or duplicating a line.

## How to use

- **The key mappings can be used in Insert, Normal and Visual mode (yes, no need to exit Insert or Visual mode)**
- The mouse can be used in Normal and Visual mode to scroll, select, change tab and more.
- There are clear visual hints on which mode you currently using. Like pink=normal, blue=insert and green=visual...

### General Mappings

**You hate those mappings? No problem, change this in your .vimrc : `UseCustomKeyBindings=0`.**

## How to add plugins to MiniVim

The [automated setup](#automated-setup) source in the main Vim configuration file *(.vimrc)* MiniVim.
This means that you have a clean and standard .vimrc. 

**To keep MiniVim, don't delete the `source [...]/MiniVim` instruction in the .vimrc file.**

To add plugins, simply follow the plugin's instructions. You should manage them with a plugin manager as [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) or the old [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

## How to use MiniVim with *sudo*

First, you could install MiniVim as root. Or better soft link your .vimrc.
But it's sometimes not the best solution, like in a company where the root user is shared.

So, you can configure your system to use MiniVim when you `sudo vim [file]`.
There are 2 solutions :
- `sudo -E vim [file]` as `-E ` preserve your existing environment variables (as $HOME here and therefore your ~/.vimrc).
- `sudoedit [file]` or `sudo -e [file]` (synonyms). To use this, you must have set your `$EDITOR` environment variable. Then, this command will make a copy of the designated file and you will edit the copy. Note that the original file will only be modified when you exit your editor ! 

## How to update MiniVim ?

First, you have to fetch the latest MiniVim. If you had cloned the repo, simply `git pull`. Else, re-download the lastest version on GitHub.

If you setup MiniVim automatically, simply re-run the installer. It will take care of everything.

If not, copy again the vimrc file to `~/.vimrc`

## Other info

The file is **heavily** commented. You're welcome to open, read and change what you want. *It's easy.*

- Work with Vim and GVim.
- Please keep in mind that some keys **cannot** be mapped as `Ctrl Shift Something` or `Ctrl Tab` because of Terminals limitations. I have to compose with this :confused: **If you're on Windows with Putty or similar, you may experience problems because of key codes.** [Look at this tip for PuTTY numeric keypad problems](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/PuTTY_numeric_keypad_mappings) and [this one for other mappings that doesn't work](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1709/how-to-fix-ctrl-arrows-in-vim).
- The color scheme is based on [https://github.com/sickill/vim-monokai](Monokai).
- Smart Paste system is based on [https://github.com/ConradIrwin/vim-bracketed-paste](ConradIrwin/vim-bracketed-paste).
- In the bottom right-hand corner, you have numbers `115/142(90%)-10`. Line `115`, total lines `142`, position at 90% in the file and column `10`.
- Tabulations will be expanded into two spaces, the default indent size.
- UTF-8 by default.
- Backups and Swapfiles are stored in `$HOME/.vim/`.
- Pressing Enter, Space or Backspace in normal mode will enter insert mode and do action.
- When re-opening a file, Vim will remember the last position.
- When opening multiple file (as `vim file1 file2`), Vim will open those files in new tabs automatically.
